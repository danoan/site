    title: Quality Analysis of Geometric Hitting Set.
    description: >
      The simple (4,3)-local-search heuristics gives a 4-approximation algorithm
      for a class of geometrical optimization problems, among them the
      Geometrical hitting set problem.

    title: Bayesian Rational in Image Processing
    description: >
      We give two examples of how Bayesian rational can be used to interpret
      methods on image denoising and regularization.
