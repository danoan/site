              <h1>Bayesian Rational in Image Processing</h1>
            </a>
						<p>Imagine you are going to receive some friends and you decide to prepare them a delicious dish whose recipe your learned in your last trip.
						Your friends love the food and they wonder what are the ingredients. They start to guess if that spicy feeling it comes from aji amarillo;
						some others are sure to have tasted cinnamon.</p>

						<p>Prepare the dish is a <i>forward problem</i>, while guessing the ingredients it is an example of an <i>inverse problem</i>. Inverse problems are usually
						ill-posed, meaning that we may have multiple solutions or not solution at all. To regularise ill-posed problems we have to include assumptions to our models.
						In  the example above, your guests could refine their guesses if you told them that all the ingredients came from south america, for example.</p>

						Image processing is a domain full of ill-posed problems, and in this post we describe how to tackle a classical one, <i>image denoising</i>, from the Bayesian point of view.

            </a>

						<p>What is the minimum number of schools you should build such that every student can arrive there in less than 30 minutes?
							The mayor cannot simply say the the problem is NP-complete, he has to do something. For example, he can propose a solution
							that is guaranteed to be close to the optimum one.</p>

							<p>In this post we explain how a simple local-search algorithm gives the best approximation ration of the geometric
								hitting set problem for disks in the plane></p>

            </a>

						<p>A track should be constructed to connect some point in space P to a lower altitude point Q.
							Which form the track should take if we wish that a ball released at P reaches Q in the shortest time?
							The curve known as tautochrone (or brachistochrone) is the answer of this puzzle solved by Jean Bernoulli
							and a classical problem of the <i>calculus of variations</i>.</p>
